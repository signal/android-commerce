# Android Commerce
A reference app designed to provide a realistic example of how to implement
Signal's Android SDK.

It communicates with a Magento based point of sale system setup with demo data
running at:
  http://commerce.signal.ninja
The commerce site, as well as the Android app, can run with the same Signal SiteId
so you can collect and track events from both systems. This allows you to exercise
all aspects of the Signal platform's data collection and processing capabilities.

Please contact your Signal representative for more information and to help setup
a demo of the application.
